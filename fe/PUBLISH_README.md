# Brontosaurus Ponderosa

A small example of using GitHub Actions to:
- build go CLI tools
- create GitHub releases
- publish to npm as a binary installable package

The CLI tools themselves:
- `brontosaurus-ponderosa` prints "Yee-Roar!" and exits
- `ponderosa-brontosaurus` prints "Roar-Yee!" and exits
